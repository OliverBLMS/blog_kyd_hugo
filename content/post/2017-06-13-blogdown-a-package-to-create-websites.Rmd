`Blogdown` is a R package to generate static websites based on [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static web engine. To be honest: It's **fantastic**!  
I've been using Wordpress for a while, with all that hassle of copy-pasting html into the wp text editor, adjusting images... Not to mention all the fuzz that goes along when using htmlwidgets. That blog-agony is all over with `blogdown`. 

## My take-ways

Must read: [Blogdown online book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/): definitely read the first 3 chapters and the appendix!
I'm using the same theme as [Rstudio Rviews blog](https://rviews.rstudio.com/), which is the [icarus theme](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-icarus-theme).  
However, for my blog I made following adjustments:

  * removed the banner placeholder
  * removed the thumbnail placeholder of the recent post in the right sidebar 
  * replaced the monokai.css with default github.css for code highlight
  * adjust correct padding of post archive

Adding disqus (comment section below each post) can be annoying, but this process should overcome minor issues:

  * add your site to disqus to retrieve the [disqusShortname](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208)
  * add your disqusShortname in the `config.toml` file
  * run `blogdown::build_site()
  * copy everything under the `public` dir to your `web` dir on your webserver
  * test, test, ... afaik.

Add an image in the `yaml` metadata of a post. This image will be used in the social-media card when sharing posts with twitter, facebook, linkedin, etc. When generating your `html` file of the post, it wil start looking for the image from the `/static` folder, so add a path from this point to your image.

  * A good post about this is [Twitter card and Open Graph images in Icarus theme for Hugo](http://www.gavinwray.com/twitter-card-and-open-graph-images-in-icarus-theme-for-hugo/)
  * You can check what your social card will look like with 
      + [Facebookâ€™s Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object/)
      + [Twitter Card validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)

## Most important take-way

There is a big difference between `blogdown::serve_site()`, `blogdown::hugo_build()` and `blogdown::build_site()`:

  * `blogdown::serve_site()` is for local use only. It will generate html files of your new/adjusted (r)markdown posts.
  * `blogdown::hugo_build()` builds the public skeleton, but will not generate new html post compared to `blogdown::serve_site()`
  * `blogdown::build_site()` builds the **whole** website for publishing, thus will render all `*.Rmd` files again. 
      + Make sure you set the `baseurl=` in the `config.toml` file correct before using `blogdown::build_site()` or `blogdown::hugo_build()`. The `baseurl` is needed to activate the disqus and the social widgets.

My publish flow exists of step 1 and 2. And step 3 is optional and only in case when I need to render everything again.

Most likely, I forgot a thing or two. So if you would like to use this theme go fetch it at  [github](https://github.com/OliverBLMS/blog_kyd_hugo).
