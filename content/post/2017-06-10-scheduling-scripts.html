<p>In most cases, you’ll write a R script that pulls data, manipulates it and dumps the output to a database or you’ll create a beautiful report in <code>rmarkdown</code>. Suppose you want to run this script or report every day, week, day, etc. Well, there are a few possibilities for automating these procedures on Windows machine.</p>
<div id="windows-task-scheduler" class="section level2">
<h2>Windows Task Scheduler:</h2>
<p>You can use the default windows task scheduler. To do so, you can create a cmd file including the path to your Rscript.exe and the path to your R script: <code>&quot;yourpathto\...\R\bin\Rscript.exe&quot; &quot;yourpathto\...\myRscript.R&quot;</code>. You can also add a log output <code>&quot;yourpathto\...\R\bin\Rscript.exe&quot; &quot;yourpathto\...\myRscript.R&quot; &gt;&gt; &quot;yourpathto\...\logfile.txt</code>. Next, add this cmd file as a new task to your windows scheduler and define the trigger conditions. Or you can do this directly withing the windows scheduler.</p>
<p>There’s a nice tutorial on youtube if you want to learn more about the basics: <a href="https://youtu.be/UDKy5_SQy2o">Scheduling R Tasks via Windows Task Scheduler</a></p>

<h2>TaskscheduleR</h2>
<p><code>taskscheduleR</code> is a recently released R package that will schedule your R scripts using <code>SCHTASKS</code>, a commandline front-end for windows’ task scheduler. This package includes most functions such as returning a list of scheduled tasks <code>taskscheduler_ls()</code>, removing a task <code>taskscheduler_delete()</code> and ofcourse adding a new task <code>taskscheduler_create()</code>. Take a look at the official blog-post from Jan Wijfels at: <a href="http://www.bnosac.be/index.php/blog/56-taskscheduler-r-package-to-schedule-r-scripts-with-the-windows-task-manager">R package to schedule R scripts with the Windows task manager</a>.</p>

<h2>Rstudio addin TaskscheduleR</h2>
<p>The source code of taskscheduleR is avaible on <a href="https://github.com/jwijffels/taskscheduleR">github</a> and i just pushed a Rstudio Addin for this package. This will allow you to add/stop/remove your task with a clean and easy UI. It also keeps a central repository for your R tasks so that you can easily edit the original script. You only need to overwrite the existing task of the same name. I’ve included a task check which will indicate if the uploaded script already exists.</p>

<h2>ScheduleR</h2>
<p>Lastly, scheduleR is a schedule framework created by <a href="https://github.com/Bart6114/scheduleR">Bart Smeets</a> and has been tested under GNU/Linux and Windows. It’s designed to be an intuitive interface for scheduling R scripts and Rmarkdown files, but also for deploying shiny apps. Yes, shiny apps! It comes with a nice web interface using Node.js and mongodb as back-end. What makes this framework so special? It has a great interface, comes with user management, keeps track of detailed logging and status reports. These status reports and the Rmarkdown reports can be send directly via email to a list of recipients or to a file directory.</p>
